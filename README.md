Fake Flash to HTML5
===================

If the right click says what is flash or html5, here's the solution!

1. Make your bad flash application
2. Import the fakehtml5.js
3. Touch $('#object').fakehtml5();
4. Done! Now your flash application is made in HTML5

Web is #sarcasm!

Why did I do that?
------------------

1. Front-end developers need to be more curious and fewer lazy
2. Right click is nothing
3. Encourage developers to view and enjoy the source code
